### Timeframe & Working Team
We worked in a group of three on this project. Having Just one week to design write test & deploy the app.
### Instructions on how to use the WatchBox app
The WatchBox App is designed for TV/film enthusiasts who want to keep track of their favourite films and shows.
It offers a convenient way to manage your watchlist and stay organized using APIs
Anytime you watch a movie or show that you really enjoy, you can add it to the WatchBox App for future reference.
You can sign up for a free account and start your media list by entering the title, release year, platform (where it can be watched), and a personal rating if you've already seen it. Once on an item's detail page, you can also add reviews and read what others have to say.
You are able to manage your watchlist by adding new movies, editing information about movies already in the list, and deleting any movies you no longer wish to keep. Additionally, you can mark movies as watched to help you track your progress.
Get started now and never lose track of your favourite films again!

The project highlighted the importance of using clear and consistent names for GitHub branches and writing meaningful commit messages when working as part of a team. It also demonstrated the benefits of keeping pull requests small and focussed.
## Wins & Learning

As this was our final project, we experienced growth both technically and as a team. We learned the value of mutual respect, collaboration, and the power of shared creativity. Working together, we were able to combine our unique skills and perspectives, which led to innovative solutions and a much richer app experience.
In the end, not only did we build an app that weâ€™re proud of, but we also strengthened our ability to work as a cohesive unit, ready to tackle even bigger projects in the future!
